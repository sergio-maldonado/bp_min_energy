This folder contains the following files:

1. 'mathematica_aided_work.nb' is a Wolfram Mathematica notebook (written in version 11.2.0.0) that supplements some of the work presented in sections 3 and 4 and Appendix C. This file can be used to reproduce any solution given in the paper. More details are given in the notebook.

2. 'value_functional.m' is a Matlab code (written in version R2017b) used to estimate numerically the functional J[h(x)] and maximum local bed slope for any given curve (e.g. solutions produced above or measured/digitised profiles). Additional details are provided in the code.

3. 'data_for_tables.xlsx' summarises the results of using the two codes above for all profiles considered in this study. These data feed into the tables of the paper. Additional notes can be found in the spreadsheet.

4. Three files with extension *.sfit are sessions for the 'cftool' toolbox of Matlab (version 2017b) that give the results of the best-fits to the measured profiles.
