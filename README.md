# bp_min_energy_codes

These codes supplement the paper by [Maldonado (2020) Do beach profiles under nonbreaking waves minimize energy dissipation? Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 125, e2019JC015876.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015876)

This folder contains the following codes:

1. 'mathematica_aided_work.nb' is a Wolfram Mathematica notebook (written in version 11.2.0.0) that supplements some of the work presented in sections 3 and 4 and Appendix C. This file can be used to reproduce any solution given in the paper. More details are given in the notebook.

2. 'value_functional.m' is a Matlab code (written in version R2017b) used to estimate numerically the functional J[h(x)] and maximum local bed slope for any given curve (e.g. solutions produced above or measured/digitised profiles). Additional details are provided in the code.
